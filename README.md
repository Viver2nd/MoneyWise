Our project has crossed the finish line! As a team, we've checked off all the boxes: MVP is in place, along with mobile responsiveness, dark mode, authentication, dynamic graphs, and seamless CRUD operations. Our collaboration has been a driving force behind our success!

## Key Learnings

Our journey with MoneyWise has been an incredible learning experience, encompassing both technical and collaborative aspects. As we developed this full-stack CRUD web app, we gained valuable insights that have expanded our skill sets and enriched our teamwork. Here are some key learnings from our MoneyWise adventure:

1. **Collaboration is Key**: Building a complex project like MoneyWise required seamless collaboration between backend and frontend developers. Regular communication, code reviews, and addressing challenges as a team greatly contributed to our success.

2. **Dynamic Graphs**: The integration of Charts.js allowed us to present data dynamically with interactive graphs. This taught us how to visualise complex data sets and present them in an easily digestible format.

3. **Version Control**: Utilising Git and GitHub throughout the project underscored the importance of version control in collaborative development, enabling efficient code management and tracking changes.
